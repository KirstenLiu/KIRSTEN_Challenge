# KIRSTEN_Challenge

I choose to solve the Coding problem from hackerrank in Python to demostrate that I can code both in Python and Go.
I did the rest of other two challenges in Go.

I name the Coding problem file validating-credit-card-number.py
Even though it says in the document that I don't need to submit in hackerrank, I did submit it and pass all the tests.
